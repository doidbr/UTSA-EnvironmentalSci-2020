# UTSA-EnvironmentalSci-2020

## Motivation and Essential Understandings
Many researchers in Ecotoxicology need to be proficient with assessing, interpreting, and communicating information about environmental hazards and their effects on life expectancy. Of particular concern in Texas is the plethora of superfund sites. 

•	Is age, gender, and/or population density predictors of life expectancy?
•	Does living near an EPA Superfund site affect life expectancy?

## Context and Dataset
Students will interpret visualizations using data from two demographic datasets: Superfund Sites (published by EPS) and Life Expectancy at Birth (published by Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS)). Students will explore correlations of various features regarding life expectancy in the state of Texas.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to:

•	Explore predictors for life expectancy in Texas

## Data Science Concepts and Skills 
1.	Summary statistics
2.	Exploratory data analysis; Static data visualization
3.	Data wrangling
4.	Hypothesis testing
5.	Predictive modeling with Decision tree; Logistic Regression

## Students
This lesson is for late undergraduate students. Students should be familiar with statistical concepts, basic data visualizations, and have worked in Excel.  

## Time to Teach this Lesson 
This lesson can be taught in 2 sessions using a worksheet
